    "Objective: This milestone focuses on developing a predictive model to help banks target customers more effectively using Logistic Regression, as well as optimizing the model through hyperparameter tuning. The results will be classified through data modeling and the goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (yes/no).<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation metric that will be used is the recall value to minimize false negatives (customers who are interested in subscribing but are classified as not interested) so that good results can be obtained. In addition, the Cross Validation value will also be used to see how the model works in distinguishing the results of the Logistic Regression from other models.<br>\n",

    "Problem: Develop a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not and optimizing it through hyperparameter tuning. The model will be evaluated using Cross Validation Score. This project will be completed within four weeks to help banks improve bank customer targeting and campaign efficiency.\n",

    "## Conceptual Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1. Jelaskan latar belakang adanya bagging dan cara kerja bagging</b><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) was developed as a solution to improve the stability and accuracy of machine learning models that are prone to overfitting. This technique was introduced by Leo Breiman to overcome the drawbacks of high variance models, such as Decision Tree, which tend to overfit the training data and perform poorly on new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Bagging Works:\n",
    "- Bootstrap Sampling<br>\n",
    "From the original dataset that has N samples, create several subsets of data (bootstrap samples) by random sampling with replacement.<br>\n",
    "Each subset has the same size as the original dataset, but since the sampling is done with returns, some samples may appear more than once, and some may not be selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Training Multiple Base Models<br>\n",
    "For each retrieved subset, train a base learner model which is usually a Decision Tree or other model that has high variance.<br>\n",
    "As each model is trained on different data, they will learn different patterns and rely less on the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ensemble Prediction (Averaging or Majority Voting)<br>\n",
    "For regression tasks: the average of the prediction results from all models is used as the final result.<br>\n",
    "For classification task: majority voting is performed, where the class most voted by the models is used as the final result.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2. Jelaskan perbedaan cara kerja algoritma Random Forest dengan algoritma boosting yang Anda pilih</b><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Decision Tree Formation: In this process, only a random subset of features is considered at each splitting node. This ensures that the resulting trees are diverse and independent of each other.\n",
    "- Node Division: Each tree is constructed by selecting features and split points that maximize the separation of the data into target classes or values.\n",
    "- Voting/Averaging: Each tree in the Random Forest produces a result, then the majority result is taken as the final decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on Linear Models: Using linear equations to model the relationship between independent and target variables.\n",
    "- Calculating Probability with Sigmoid Function: Logistic Regression predicts the probability of a class based on a linear combination of features.\n",
    "- Determining Threshold: If the probability is greater than 0.5, the prediction is 1 (positive), if less than 0.5, then 0 (negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3. Jelaskan apa yang dimaksud dengan Cross Validation</b><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross Validation is a technique in machine learning that is used to evaluate model performance by dividing the dataset into several parts to train and test the model in turn. This technique is used to ensure that the model created is not overfitting the training data and can generalize well to new data."

    "\n",
    "2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights\n",
    "Key features such as duration, balance, previous interactions, and campaign contact type showed strong correlation with subscription likelihood.\n",
    "The dataset exhibited class imbalance, requiring the use of techniques like class weighting or SMOTE to ensure better model performance.\n",

    "3. Model Performance (Logistic Regression & Hyperparameter Tuning)\n",
    "The baseline Logistic Regression model provided a good starting point but needed further optimization.\n",
    "After hyperparameter tuning, performance improved, especially in terms of recall, ensuring better identification of potential subscribers.\n",
    "Other models, such as Random Forest or SVM, could further improve classification results, particularly for handling complex decision boundaries.\n",

    "4. Cross Validation Results & Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "The final tuned model achieved higher recall, making it better suited for identifying potential term deposit subscribers.\n",

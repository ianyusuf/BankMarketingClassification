# 🏦 Bank Marketing Classification
This project aims to analyze marketing campaign data from a bank to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit. The classification model helps identify high-potential customers and optimize campaign strategies.

# 📚 Business Understanding

## 📌 Background
**Objective**: This milestone focuses on developing a predictive model to help banks target customers more effectively using Logistic Regression, as well as optimizing the model through hyperparameter tuning. The results will be classified through data modeling and the goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (yes/no).
The evaluation metric that will be used is the recall value to minimize false negatives (customers who are interested in subscribing but are classified as not interested) so that good results can be obtained. In addition, the Cross Validation value will also be used to see how the model works in distinguishing the results of the Logistic Regression from other models.

**Problem**: Develop a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not and optimizing it through hyperparameter tuning. The model will be evaluated using Cross Validation Score. This project will be completed within four weeks to help banks improve bank customer targeting and campaign efficiency.

## ✅ Problem Breakdown
- What customer features influence the likelihood of subscribing to a term deposit?
- Which customer segments have the highest conversion rates?
- How do marketing channels and contact timing affect deposit subscription?
- Which classification models yield the best performance for this task?

## 👥 Target Users

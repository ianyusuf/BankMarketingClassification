# Bank Marketing Classification

## Repository Outline
`Objective: This milestone focuses on developing a predictive model to help banks target customers more effectively using Logistic Regression, as well as optimizing the model through hyperparameter tuning. The results will be classified through data modeling and the goal is to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit (yes/no).`

## Problem Background
`Develop a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not and optimizing it through hyperparameter tuning. The model will be evaluated using Cross Validation Score. This project will be completed within four weeks to help banks improve bank customer targeting and campaign efficiency.`

## Project Output
`This project produces a predictive Logistic Regression model that can help banks target customers more effectively. The output includes a trained model, evaluation report, code in the repository, performance visualization, and clear documentation.`

## Data
`The data source comes from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/222/bank+marketing. The data I took amounted to 4521 rows of data, with a total of 17 columns, and no missing values.`

## Method
`Model that I used in this milestones is Logistic Regression model that has been optimized through hyperparameter tuning.`

## Stacks
`Python, Pandas, Numpy, Pickle, Scikit-learn, Scipy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Feature Engine`
